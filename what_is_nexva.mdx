## Chat about Anything — including files and images

Start conversations on any topic. You can attach screenshots, documents, or images and get clear, actionable responses — explanations, suggestions, or ideas — all within the same chat.

## Summarize Documents and Videos

Quickly extract the key points from long articles, reports, or recorded videos. Perfect when you need a concise overview instead of reading or watching the entire content.

## Speed up Reading: Webpages, Selections, and Email

Highlight text on a page, paste an email, or feed in an article — Nexva will produce a short digest so you can consume information faster and focus only on what matters.

## Improve Your Writing

Whether it's emails, reports, or short posts, Nexva helps refine tone, grammar, and structure so your message is clearer and more effective.

## Search with Greater Accuracy

Use the Search Assistant and Search Panel to locate information quickly and receive more relevant results than a standard web search — saving time when researching or fact-finding.

## Translate 50+ Languages

Translate text, pages, and documents across many languages. Built-in grammar and style checks help keep translations natural and readable.

## Create and Edit Images

Generate images from prompts or edit existing pictures with simple controls — crop, retouch, or change style without leaving your browser.

## Analyze Data and Code

Get help understanding datasets, spotting trends, or reviewing code. The Data & Code Assistants provide explanations, suggestions, and quick fixes for common issues.

## Draft Smart Replies

Compose thoughtful replies to emails and comments using suggested phrasing tailored to the context and tone you want.
