# Supported File Formats & Upload Limits

This page explains which file formats Nexva supports and how file upload size limits vary based on your subscription plan.

Understanding these limits helps you upload files successfully and get the best results from the AI assistant.

---

## Overview

Nexva allows you to upload files so the AI can:
- Read and summarize documents
- Analyze structured data
- Extract text from images
- Assist with coding and configuration files

File upload limits depend on:
- Your **subscription plan**
- The **AI model** being used
- The **type of file** you upload

---

## File Upload Size Limits by Plan

Each Nexva plan has a maximum file size limit per uploaded file.

### Upload Limits Table

| Plan Type | Maximum File Size (Per File) | Notes |
|---------|------------------------------|------|
| Free / Trial | Up to **2 MB** | Best for short documents and small images |
| Basic | Up to **5 MB** | Suitable for PDFs, spreadsheets, and reports |
| Pro | Up to **10 MB** | Supports larger documents and datasets |
| Business / Enterprise | Up to **25 MB or more** | Designed for large files and advanced workflows |

> Upload limits apply **per file**, not per conversation.

## Why File Size Limits Exist

File size limits are enforced due to:
- AI model context limits
- Processing performance
- Cost and reliability constraints
- Underlying AI provider restrictions

Even if your plan allows larger uploads, extremely large files may still require splitting.

---

## Unsupported File Formats

Some formats are not supported directly, such as:
- Executable files (`.exe`, `.app`)
- Compressed archives (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`)
- Proprietary binary formats

### What to Do If a File Isn’t Supported

If your file type isn’t supported:
- Convert it to a supported format (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.csv`)
- Extract relevant content and upload it separately
- Split the file into smaller parts

---

## Large File Handling Tips

If your file exceeds your plan’s upload limit:

- Split large documents into sections
- Upload only the relevant pages
- Convert images to compressed formats (e.g., `webp`)
- Remove unnecessary images or embedded media

This improves performance and reduces credit usage.

---

## Model-Specific Considerations

Even if your plan supports large files:
- Some AI models have smaller context limits
- Large files may be partially processed
- Results may be summarized instead of fully analyzed

For best results:
- Use models with large context windows
- Clearly specify what the AI should focus on

---

## What Happens If I Exceed the Limit?

If you try to upload a file that exceeds your plan limit:
- The upload will fail
- You’ll see an error message
- The file will not be processed

You can:
- Reduce the file size
- Upgrade your plan
- Split the file and upload in parts

---

## Security & Privacy for Uploaded Files

All uploaded files are:
- Processed securely
- Used only to complete your request
- Handled according to Nexva’s Data Security & Privacy policies

Files are not shared with other users.

---

## Best Practices for File Uploads

For optimal results:
- Upload only what is necessary
- Clearly describe what you want the AI to do
- Avoid uploading extremely large files at once
- Use supported formats whenever possible

---
