# Supported formats and limitations

This page explains which file sizes and formats are currently supported when you upload content for the assistant to use.

## Acceptable file sizes

Most AI models used by the assistant can process files up to **5 MB** each.

These limits are enforced by the underlying AI providers rather than by the app itself, so you may see similar restrictions across different tools that rely on the same models.

## Acceptable file formats

The assistant can work with the most common document and image formats used for storing text and structured information.

- **Images**: `webp`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `svg`
- **Documents and data**: `html`, `csv`, `xls`, `xlsx`, `pdf`, `txt`, `doc`, `docx`, `json`, `md`, `sh`, and other plain-text–based formats

If a format isn’t supported, try converting it to one of the types listed above (for example, exporting to `.pdf` or `.txt`) before uploading.
