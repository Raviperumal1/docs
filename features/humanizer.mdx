AI Humanizer transforms AI-generated text into **natural, human-like writing**.
It rewrites content to reduce detectable AI patterns while preserving the original meaning, tone, and intent.

This feature is designed for users who want content that reads as if it were written by a human rather than a generative AI system.

## What AI Humanizer Does

AI Humanizer focuses on **language refinement**, not content creation.

### Core Capabilities
- Rewrites AI-generated text into human-level language
- Reduces common AI writing patterns
- Improves natural flow and readability
- Preserves original meaning and context
- Produces detection-resistant output

### What It Does Not Do
- It does not change factual meaning
- It does not add new ideas or opinions
- It does not guarantee undetectability
- It does not plagiarize human-written sources


## Supported Input Types

Users can submit content through:

- Plain text input
- Uploaded files (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- OCR-extracted screenshots
- Webpage or article text

For best results, input text should be **at least 100 characters**.


## High-Level Workflow

1. User inputs AI-generated text
2. Text preprocessing and normalization
3. AI pattern detection
4. Humanization strategy selection
5. Sentence-level rewriting
6. Style and fluency refinement
7. Final humanized output


## Step 1: Text Preprocessing

Before rewriting, the system prepares the input text:

- Removes formatting artifacts
- Normalizes punctuation and casing
- Splits text into sentences and paragraphs
- Detects language automatically
- Identifies overly repetitive or uniform patterns


## Step 2: AI Pattern Identification

The system detects common AI-generated signals, including:

- Overly consistent sentence length
- Predictable grammar structures
- Generic transitions and phrasing
- Excessive neutrality
- Low linguistic variance

These signals guide how aggressively the text should be rewritten.


## Step 3: Humanization Strategy Selection

Based on detected patterns, the system chooses one or more strategies:

- Sentence restructuring
- Vocabulary diversification
- Natural rhythm variation
- Contextual rephrasing
- Subtle imperfection injection

The goal is to match **real human writing behavior**, not randomness.


## Step 4: Sentence-Level Rewriting

Each sentence is rewritten independently while maintaining coherence:

- Sentence lengths are varied
- Passive constructions are reduced
- Repetitive phrases are replaced
- Natural pauses and transitions are introduced

Meaning and intent remain unchanged.


## Step 5: Fluency and Style Refinement

After rewriting, the system performs a fluency pass:

- Improves readability
- Ensures logical flow
- Fixes awkward phrasing
- Aligns tone with original input

This step ensures the output feels natural, not artificial.


## Output Characteristics

Humanized output typically shows:

- Higher linguistic variance
- More natural sentence rhythm
- Less predictable phrasing
- Improved readability

The content remains faithful to the original message.
