# AI Content Detection

AI Content Detection helps determine whether a given piece of text is **AI-generated**, **human-written**, or **mixed**.
This feature analyzes linguistic patterns, statistical signals, and model-based probabilities to estimate the likelihood that content was produced by generative AI systems.

This document provides a **complete, end-to-end explanation** of how AI Content Detection works, from user input to final confidence scoring.

---

## What AI Content Detection

### What it does
- Analyzes **user-submitted text**
- Detects **AI-like language patterns**
- Estimates **probability scores** for:
  - AI-generated content
  - Human-written content
  - Mixed or edited content

### What it does NOT do
- It does **not** identify the exact AI model used
- It does **not** guarantee 100% accuracy
- It does **not** judge intent, plagiarism, or originality

AI Content Detection provides **probabilistic insights**, not absolute proof.

---

## High-Level Workflow

1. User inputs text
2. Text preprocessing and normalization
3. Linguistic feature extraction
4. Statistical pattern analysis
5. AI model probability scoring
6. Confidence aggregation
7. Final classification and explanation

---

## Step 1: User Input

Users can submit text through:
- Direct text input
- Uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Screenshots (OCR-processed)
- Webpage or article extraction

**Supported languages:**
English (primary), with limited support for other languages depending on model availability.

---

## Step 2: Text Preprocessing

Before analysis, the system cleans and normalizes the text:

- Removes extra whitespace and formatting
- Normalizes punctuation and casing
- Splits text into sentences and tokens
- Detects language and encoding
- Filters extremely short or invalid inputs

> Detection accuracy improves with **longer inputs (150+ words)**.

---

## Step 3: Linguistic Feature Analysis

The system examines **human vs AI writing behavior**, including:

### Lexical Patterns
- Vocabulary diversity
- Repetitive word usage
- Overuse of neutral or generic phrasing

### Syntactic Structure
- Sentence length uniformity
- Predictable grammar constructions
- Low syntactic variance

### Semantic Flow
- Overly coherent transitions
- Lack of human-like digressions
- Excessively balanced sentence structures

AI-generated text often appears **too consistent**, while human writing shows more irregularity.

---

## Step 4: Statistical Signal Detection

Statistical signals are strong indicators of AI generation.

### Perplexity
- Measures how predictable the text is
- AI text typically has **lower perplexity**
- Human text has **higher randomness**

### Burstiness
- Measures variation in sentence complexity
- Humans write with uneven rhythm
- AI often produces smooth, evenly structured output

### Token Distribution
- Frequency of common AI-preferred tokens
- Repetitive probability patterns

---

## Step 5: AI Model Probability Scoring

The system uses **AI detection models** trained on:
- Large datasets of human-written text
- Outputs from multiple generative AI models
- Edited and mixed-content samples

Each model returns:
- AI likelihood score
- Human likelihood score
- Confidence level

Multiple models may be ensembled to reduce bias.

---

## Step 6: Confidence Aggregation

All signals are combined into a unified confidence score using:
- Weighted averaging
- Threshold-based classification
- Noise reduction filters

### Example Output Scores
- **AI-generated:** 92%
- **Human-written:** 6%
- **Mixed:** 2%

Confidence levels are adjusted based on:
- Text length
- Language quality
- Detected edits or paraphrasing

---

## Step 7: Final Classification

The system returns one of the following results:

### AI-Generated
- Strong AI linguistic and statistical patterns
- High predictability and uniformity

### Human-Written
- Natural variance and unpredictability
- Irregular sentence structure
- Human-like phrasing

### Mixed / Uncertain
- AI-generated text edited by humans
- Heavily paraphrased AI content
- Insufficient text length

---

## Result Explanation (Transparency Layer)

To improve trust, the system may show:
- Key signals that influenced the result
- Confidence range (not absolute certainty)
- Warnings for low-confidence detections

Example:
> “This text shows low perplexity and uniform sentence structure, commonly found in AI-generated content.”

---

## Accuracy & Limitations

### Accuracy Depends On
- Text length
- Language used
- Degree of human editing
- AI model version

### Known Limitations
- Short text (<100 words)
- Highly technical writing
- Heavy paraphrasing
- Non-native English writing

AI Content Detection should be used as a **decision-support tool**, not a sole authority.

---

## Best Practices for Users

- Submit longer text for better accuracy
- Avoid judging based on a single score
- Combine detection results with human review
- Treat results as probabilistic, not definitive

---

## Supported Input Formats

- Plain text
- PDF
- DOCX
- TXT
- Webpage content
- OCR-extracted images

---

## Output Formats

- Text summary
- Confidence percentages
- Explanatory signals
- Structured JSON (API usage)

---

## Use Cases

- Academic integrity checks
- Content moderation
- SEO and content audits
- Publishing and editorial review
- Enterprise compliance workflows

---

## Future Improvements

- Multi-language detection expansion
- Model attribution estimation
- Version-aware AI detection
- Improved mixed-content analysis
