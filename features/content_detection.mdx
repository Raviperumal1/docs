# AI Content Detection

AI Content Detection analyzes text and estimates whether it was written by an artificial intelligence system, a human, or a combination of both.
The feature uses linguistic analysis, statistical modeling, and machine-learned signals to provide probabilistic detection results.

This document explains the feature **from start to finish**, including workflow, detection logic, output interpretation, and API usage.

## What AI Content Detection Solves

- Identifies AI-generated writing patterns
- Flags human-written versus AI-written text
- Supports editorial, academic, and compliance workflows
- Provides confidence-based results instead of absolute claims

AI Content Detection is designed to assist decision-making, not replace human judgment.

---

## Supported Inputs

You can analyze content from the following sources:

- Plain text
- Uploaded files (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
- OCR-extracted screenshots
- Webpage or article content

For best accuracy, provide at least **150 characters** of text.

---

## High-Level Workflow

1. User submits text
2. Text normalization and preprocessing
3. Linguistic feature extraction
4. Statistical signal analysis
5. AI probability modeling
6. Confidence aggregation
7. Final classification

---

## Step 1: Text Preprocessing

Before detection begins, the system:

- Removes unnecessary formatting
- Normalizes punctuation and spacing
- Splits text into sentences and tokens
- Detects language automatically
- Rejects extremely short or invalid input

This step ensures consistent and reliable analysis.

---

## Step 2: Linguistic Analysis

The system evaluates how the text is written.

### Lexical Signals
- Vocabulary diversity
- Word repetition patterns
- Neutral or generic phrasing frequency

### Structural Signals
- Sentence length consistency
- Grammar predictability
- Syntactic variation

Human writing usually contains more variation and irregularity than AI-generated text.

---

## Step 3: Statistical Pattern Detection

### Perplexity
Measures how predictable the text is.
Lower perplexity often indicates AI-generated content.

### Burstiness
Measures variation in sentence structure.
Human writing tends to be uneven, while AI text is more uniform.

---

## Step 4: AI Probability Modeling

Detection models are trained using:

- Human-authored writing samples
- Outputs from multiple generative AI models
- Edited and mixed-content datasets

Each model produces likelihood scores for AI-generated and human-written text.

---

## Step 5: Confidence Aggregation

Multiple signals are combined into a final confidence score.

Example output:
- AI-generated likelihood: 0.91
- Human-written likelihood: 0.07
- Mixed content likelihood: 0.02

Confidence levels are adjusted based on text length and detected edits.

---

## Final Classification Types

| Classification | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| ai_generated | Strong indicators of AI authorship |
| human_written | Natural human writing patterns |
| mixed | AI-generated text edited by a human |
| uncertain | Insufficient evidence |

---

## Result Interpretation

Results are probabilistic and should be interpreted carefully.

- High confidence means stronger signals
- Medium confidence suggests mixed indicators
- Low confidence means insufficient or ambiguous data

Detection accuracy decreases for short or heavily paraphrased text.
