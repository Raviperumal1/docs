# AI Image Generation

AI Image Generation allows users to create visuals from text descriptions using powerful generative models.
This feature converts **text prompts into detailed images** and supports various styles, formats, and use cases.

This documentation covers **all possible usage scenarios**, how the system works, how to craft prompts, how to configure output, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Why Use AI Image Generation

AI Image Generation can be used to:

- Produce original visual artworks and illustrations
- Create marketing visuals and banners
- Generate concept art and product mockups

## Supported Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Prompt to Image

You want a visual based on a straightforward description.

Example:
> “A whimsical forest with glowing flowers under a moonlit sky”

Result:
→ One or more generated images matching the narrative.

---

### Scenario 2: Style-Specific Generation

You want images in a particular artistic style.

Example:
> “A futuristic city skyline at night, cyberpunk style, neon lights”

Important focus areas:
- Style (cyberpunk, watercolor, oil painting, anime)
- Lighting (dramatic, soft, high contrast)
- Composition descriptors (foreground, background, angle)

---

### Scenario 3: Reference-Guided Generation

You provide a reference image to guide style, composition, or subject.

- Upload an image
- Describe how the new image should relate
  - Eg: “Recreate this scene with a summer vibe and warm tones”

This helps align model outputs with existing visual assets.

---

### Scenario 4: Iterative Refinement

You want to refine an existing output:

1. Generate initial images
2. View and select candidates
3. Modify prompt to add or remove elements
4. Regenerate variations
5. Repeat until desired outcome

---

### Scenario 5: Batch Creation

You need **multiple related images** for a project:

- Use templates like:
  - “Scene 1: ...”
  - “Scene 2: ...”
  - etc.

Batch generation can help quickly produce entire sets of visuals with consistent styles.
