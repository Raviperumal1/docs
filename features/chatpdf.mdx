     - Maintains context across chunks
     - Typical chunk size: 500-1000 tokens
   - **Overlap Implementation**: Creates overlapping chunks to preserve context
     - Overlap size: 50-200 tokens
     - Prevents loss of information at boundaries
   - **Metadata Tagging**: Each chunk tagged with:
     - Page number
     - Section heading
     - Chunk position
     - Character offset

**4. Embedding Generation**
   - **Vector Embeddings**: Converts text chunks to numerical vectors
     - Uses models like OpenAI embeddings, sentence-transformers
     - Typical dimensions: 768 or 1536
     - Captures semantic meaning
   - **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple chunks simultaneously
   - **Error Handling**: Retries failed embeddings
   - **Quality Checks**: Validates embedding quality

**5. Vector Database Storage**
   - **Database**: Stores embeddings in vector database (e.g., Chroma, Pinecone, Weaviate)
   - **Indexing**: Creates searchable index for fast retrieval
   - **Metadata Storage**: Links embeddings to original text and metadata
   - **Optimization**: Builds efficient data structures for similarity search

**6. Full-Text Indexing**
   - **Search Index**: Creates traditional keyword search index

### Embedding Generation Explained

Embeddings are the core technology enabling semantic search:

**What Are Embeddings?**
- Numerical vector representations of text
- Capture semantic meaning, not just keywords
- Allow finding similar content even with different wording
- Example: "automobile" and "car" have similar embeddings

**Embedding Models Used**:
- **OpenAI Embeddings**: `text-embedding-ada-002` or `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Sentence Transformers**: Open-source alternatives like `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tuned for specific domains

**Embedding Process**:
1. Text chunk (e.g., "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
2. Tokenization: Split into tokens
3. Model inference: Convert to vector (e.g., 1536 dimensions)
4. Vector: `[0.002, -0.123, 0.456, ..., 0.089]`

**Why Embeddings Matter**:
- Enable semantic search ("find similar concepts")
- Power question-answering capabilities
- Allow cross-lingual search (with multilingual models)
- Improve retrieval accuracy over keyword search
