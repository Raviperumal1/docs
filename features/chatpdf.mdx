# Chat with PDF (ChatPDF)

ChatPDF allows you to interact with PDFs and other files as if you were chatting with them.
You can ask questions, summarize sections, extract data, translate content, and perform deep research directly on your documents.

This guide explains the **full workflow**, exactly as it works in the interface—from uploading a PDF to chatting, model selection, and error handling.

### 1.1 Uploading a PDF

To upload a PDF:

1. Open **ChatPDF** from the sidebar
2. Click **Upload File**
3. Select a PDF from your computer

Each uploaded PDF has its own chat context.

### 1.2 What Happens After Upload

After upload, the system performs the following steps:

1. Extracts text from the PDF
2. Applies OCR if the PDF is scanned
3. Splits content into pages and chunks
4. Generates embeddings
5. Stores embeddings in the vector database
6. Indexes content for retrieval

Only after indexing completes can document chat begin.

## 2. Viewing and Navigating the PDF

In the PDF viewer, you can:

- Scroll through pages
- Jump to a specific page
- View total page count
- Switch between PDFs

The AI references the currently indexed document, not just the visible page.

---

## 3. Selecting an AI Model

At the top of the chat panel, you can choose an AI model.

### Model Selection Steps

1. Click the model dropdown
2. Select a model (for example, GPT-4o-mini)
3. The selected model is used for all responses in this chat

### Model Selection Tips

- Lightweight models are faster for summaries
- Advanced models are better for deep reasoning
- Model choice does not change document indexing
