Prompt writing is the most important skill when working with AI.
A **prompt** is the instruction you give the AI that defines **what to do, how to do it, and how the output should look**.

This document provides a **complete, end-to-end guide** to writing high-quality prompts in Nexva for better accuracy, consistency, and efficiency.

## What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is **any input sent to an AI model**, including:

- Questions
- Instructions
- Tasks
- Requests for transformation
- Descriptions for image generation
- Commands applied to uploaded files

The AI uses your prompt as its **only source of intent**.

## Why Prompt Quality Matters

AI models respond based on probability and patterns.
They do not understand intent unless you clearly express it.

Poor prompts lead to:
- Incorrect answers
- Hallucinations
- Irrelevant output
- Wasted credits

Well-written prompts lead to:
- Accurate responses
- Predictable formatting
- Faster results
- Lower retry cost

## How AI Interprets Prompts

When a prompt is submitted, the AI tries to infer:

1. The task type (explain, write, summarize, generate)
2. The domain (technical, creative, business, casual)
3. The expected depth (short vs detailed)
4. The output format
5. Any constraints or rules

Ambiguity at any step reduces quality.

## Prompt Writing Fundamentals

At its core, every effective prompt answers five questions:

1. **What** should the AI do?
2. **Who** is the output for?
3. **How detailed** should it be?
4. **How** should it be formatted?
5. **What constraints** must be followed?

## The Core Prompt Formula

A reliable structure for prompts is:

```text
[Role] + [Task] + [Context] + [Constraints] + [Output Format]
