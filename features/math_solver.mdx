AI Math Solver helps users solve mathematical problems with **clear step-by-step explanations**.
It supports problems ranging from **basic arithmetic to advanced university-level mathematics**, including problems submitted as text, images, screenshots, or documents.

This document explains **how AI Math Solver works**, supported topics, workflows, and best practices.


## What AI Math Solver Does

AI Math Solver is designed to:

- Solve math problems accurately
- Explain each step in human-readable form
- Handle handwritten or printed math via images
- Support symbolic, numeric, and word problems
- Assist learning rather than just providing answers

It focuses on **understanding and reasoning**, not just final results.

## Supported Input Types

Users can submit problems using:

- Plain text input
- Mathematical expressions
- Word problems
- Uploaded files (PDF, DOCX)
- Images and screenshots (handwritten or printed)
- Extracted math from webpages

Clear input improves accuracy, especially for complex problems.

## High-Level Workflow

1. User submits a math problem
2. Input normalization and parsing
3. Problem type detection
4. Mathematical reasoning and solving
5. Step-by-step explanation generation
6. Final answer presentation


## Step 1: Input Parsing and Normalization

Before solving, the system:

- Detects mathematical symbols and operators
- Converts handwritten or scanned math to text
- Normalizes equations and expressions
- Identifies variables, constants, and constraints
- Detects the math domain

This ensures the solver understands the problem structure.


## Step 2: Problem Type Detection

The solver automatically identifies the category of the problem, such as:

- Arithmetic
- Algebra
- Geometry
- Trigonometry
- Calculus
- Linear Algebra
- Probability and Statistics
- Discrete Mathematics
- Number Theory
- Optimization

This determines which solving strategy to apply.


## Step 3: Mathematical Reasoning Engine

The AI applies symbolic and numeric reasoning:

- Equation manipulation
- Logical deduction
- Algebraic transformations
- Formula application
- Approximation when needed

The solver prioritizes **exact solutions** before approximations.


## Step 4: Step-by-Step Explanation

Each solution includes:

- Clear intermediate steps
- Mathematical justification
- Simplified explanations
- Optional hints and breakdowns

The goal is to help users **learn how to solve**, not just copy answers.
