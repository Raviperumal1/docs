# Rules for Using Advanced Queries

Effective Date: September 12, 2024

Advanced Queries in **Nexva** enable powerful capabilities like deep research, file analysis, data extraction, extended web reasoning, and advanced model operations.
This page explains how Advanced Queries work, how credits are consumed, plan allocations, pricing, and how to optimize usage.

<Info>
Advanced Queries are only triggered when a task requires additional computation, external retrieval, or advanced tool usage. Standard chat messages do not use Advanced Query credits.
</Info>

## What Are Advanced Queries?

Advanced Queries are special operations where Nexva must:

- Retrieve or analyze external information
- Perform multi-step reasoning
- Process long or structured files
- Execute tool-assisted operations
- Run extended multi-source web searches
- Handle image, audio, or document-based reasoning
- Use high-context or high-compute LLM capabilities

These require higher compute resources and therefore consume **Advanced Query Credits**.

---

## When Does an Advanced Query Activate?

Nexva automatically detects when a query qualifies as “advanced.”

### **1. Requests requiring updated online information**
Examples:
- “What are today’s crypto gainers?”
- “Summarize today’s AI news.”

### **2. Deep PDF/document analysis**
Examples:
- “Extract all tables from this 20-page report.”
- “Identify sections discussing renewal policies.”

### **3. Multi-step research**
Examples:
- “Compare data from these three sources.”
- “Summarize pros/cons of two competing platforms.”

### **4. Data processing**
Examples:
- Parse CSV
- Clean a dataset
- Identify trends in an Excel sheet

### **5. File-based reasoning**
Examples:
- “Extract values from this invoice.”
- “Explain this screenshot or chart.”

---

## What Does *Not* Count as an Advanced Query?

These remain **standard chat** and cost **0 credits**:

- Simple questions
- Writing, rewriting, tone editing
- Grammar correction
- Short summaries
- Code debugging for small snippets
- Basic reasoning that does not require external tools

# Chat Context Management

Nexva supports two context modes:

### **Smart Trimming (Default)**
The system automatically trims previous messages to optimize credit usage.

### **Custom Limit**
You choose how much context is preserved.
This mode **consumes Advanced Query Credits** based on token count.

**Important Notes:**

- System prompts also count toward context size
- Long conversations increase compute usage
- Start a new chat to reset context
- Maximum supported context depends on model (e.g., GPT-4o supports ~128k tokens)

---

# How Are Advanced Query Credits Counted?

Each advanced operation deducts **1 credit**, regardless of:

- Output length
- Model scale
- File size (unless extremely large)
- Complexity of process

### **Batch operations**
Uploading multiple files may trigger **multiple** advanced operations.

---

# How to Check Remaining Credits

Go to:

**Nexva → Settings → Usage → Advanced Query Credits**

You can view:

- Remaining credits
- Daily limits
- Monthly allocation
- Next reset date

Credits auto-reset each billing cycle.

---

# Tips to Avoid Wasting Credits

### **1. Be specific**
❌ “Summarize this.”
✔️ “Summarize this PDF in 8–10 bullet points focusing on financial performance.”

### **2. Avoid repeating the same request**
Use:
- **Quote**
- **Follow-up prompts**
- **Refine output**

### **3. Split large documents**
Analyze sections instead of entire files to reduce triggers.

### **4. Use standard chat for simple tasks**
Do not use advanced mode unless necessary.

---

# Common Questions

### **Do all file uploads use credits?**
No. Only deep analysis triggers credits.

### **Does rewriting text cost credits?**
No — rewriting stays in normal chat mode.

### **What happens if I run out of credits?**
Advanced features pause. Standard chatting continues normally.
