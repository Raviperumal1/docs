# Rules for using Advanced Queries

Effective Date: December 1, 2025

To better support features with varying cost levels and enhance the flexibility of Instaai’s pricing plans, advanced credits have been introduced. These credits allow you to use more advanced features and reset monthly.

## Monthly Advanced Credits for Subscription Plans

Advanced credits are **only available to subscribers**. Without a subscription, you cannot earn or use advanced credits. Subscribers receive a fixed number of advanced credits monthly in addition to the basic query allowance.

| Plan      | Basic Queries  | Advanced Credits               |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Free      | 40/day          | 0                              |
| Pro       | 5,000/month     | 200/month (+1,500 extra)       |
| Unlimited | Unlimited*       | 4,500/month                    |

\* The “Unlimited” plan still includes technical protections:
1,600 unrestricted advanced model queries/month + 12,000 basic queries/month.
When these quotas are depleted, further usage is restricted to ~100/day.

## Purchasing Extra Advanced Credits

If you run out of advanced credits, you may purchase more:

| Credits | Price  |
|---------|--------|
| 4,000   | US$10  |
| 12,000  | US$30  |
| 40,000  | US$100 |

## Image Generation & Credit Consumption

The counting method for image generation has been updated. Instead of counting by “instances,” usage is now tracked by **advanced credit consumption**, which varies by model.

For example, generating one image using the **SDXL** model consumes **3 advanced credits**.

Here’s how many images you could generate if you used all of your advanced credits for this purpose:

- **Free plan:** ~4 images (trial)
- **Pro plan:** ~500 images/month
- **Unlimited plan:** ~1,500 images/month

## Chat Context, Modes & Trimming

With advanced credits, Insta ai now offers two chat modes:

### Smart Trimming (Default)

Context is automatically trimmed based on chat content to maintain quality responses while controlling usage.
This mode uses both basic and advanced query counts depending on the model.

### Custom Limit

Available only to members.
You can choose to retain full context or manually set a trimming limit.
This consumes advanced credits per query.

## Important Notes

- System prompts count toward total context length. Disabling unnecessary chat skills can reduce usage.
- Longer conversations use more context. Starting new chats periodically helps manage consumption.
- Copying large files or using full-text reading mode is supported but consumes advanced credits.
