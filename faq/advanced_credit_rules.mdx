# Rules for using Advanced Queries

Effective Date: September 12, 2024

To better support features with varying cost levels and enhance the flexibility of Monica’s pricing plans, advanced credits have been introduced. These credits allow you to use more advanced features and reset monthly. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Monthly Advanced Credits for Subscription Plans

Advanced credits are **only available to subscribers**. Without a subscription, you cannot earn or use advanced credits. Subscribers receive a fixed number of advanced credits monthly in addition to the basic query allowance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

| Plan | Basic Queries | Advanced Credits |
|------|---------------|------------------|
| Free | 40/day | 0 |
| Pro | 5,000/month | 200/month (+ 1,500/month extra) |
| Unlimited | Unlimited* | 4,500/month |

\* Note: The “Unlimited” plan still includes technical protections: e.g., 1,600 unrestricted advanced model queries/month + 12,000 basic queries/month. When these quotas are depleted, further usage will be restricted to ~100/day. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Purchasing Extra Advanced Credits

If you run out of advanced credits, you may purchase more:

| Credits | Price |
|---------|--------|
| 4,000 | US$10 |
| 12,000 | US$30 |
| 40,000 | US$100 | :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Image Generation & Credit Consumption

The counting method for image generation has been updated: instead of “instances”, usage is now tracked by advanced credit consumption (different models use different amounts). For example, generating one image using the SDXL model consumes 3 advanced credits. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

Here’s how many images you could generate (if you used all your advanced credits for this purpose):

- Free plan: previously 0 → now ~4 images (trial) :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
- Pro: ~500 images/month :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
- Unlimited: ~1,500 images/month :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## Chat Context, Modes & Trimming

With advanced credits, Monica now offers two chat modes:

### Smart Trimming (Default)
In this mode, context is automatically trimmed based on chat content so you get good responses while controlling usage. It uses both basic and advanced query counts depending on model. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

### Custom Limit
Available only to members. You can either retain full context or set a manual trimming limit. This consumes advanced credits per query. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

**Important Notes:**
- System prompts also count towards total context length; disabling unnecessary chat skills reduces usage. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}
- Longer conversations use more context; it’s recommended to start new chats periodically to manage consumption. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}
- Copying large files / full-text reading mode is supported but consumes advanced credits. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
