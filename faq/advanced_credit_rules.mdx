Advanced Queries in Nexva enable high-compute operations such as deep reasoning, file analysis, web retrieval, image or video generation, and audio transcription.

This document explains the **full internal workflow**:
- How Advanced Queries are detected
- How credits are consumed
- How input and output tokens are counted
- How audio transcription works
- How free and paid plans are handled

---

## What Is an Advanced Query

An Advanced Query is automatically triggered when a request requires **additional computation, tools, or extended context** beyond standard chat.

These operations consume **Advanced Query Credits**.

---

## High-Level Advanced Query Workflow

1. User submits input (text, file, image, audio, or video)
2. System classifies request type
3. Credit eligibility is evaluated
4. Token usage is estimated
5. Advanced Query credit is deducted (if required)
6. Task is executed
7. Output is generated and returned
8. Usage is logged and displayed in settings

---

## Step 1: User Input Types

Advanced Queries may be triggered by the following inputs:

- Long or complex text prompts
- Uploaded files (PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX)
- Images or screenshots
- Audio files for transcription
- Video generation requests
- Web-based or real-time queries

Simple text chat does **not** trigger Advanced Queries.

---

## Step 2: Advanced Query Detection Logic

Nexva evaluates the request using multiple signals:

### Triggers That Activate Advanced Queries

- External data retrieval
- File or document analysis
- Multi-step reasoning
- Large context windows
- Image, audio, or video processing
- High-tier AI model usage
- Tool-assisted operations

If **any** of these are required, the query is classified as advanced.

---

## What Does NOT Trigger an Advanced Query

The following remain **free standard chat**:

- Grammar correction
- Rewriting or paraphrasing
- Tone changes
- Short summaries
- Small code fixes
- General Q&A without tools
- Humanizer operations
- Basic math reasoning

These cost **0 credits**.

---

## Step 3: Credit Eligibility Check

Once classified as advanced, the system checks:

- User subscription plan
- Remaining monthly credits
- Daily free credit allowance
- Add-on credit balance

If credits are available, execution proceeds.

---

## Free User Credit Allocation

Free users receive:

- **100 Advanced Query Credits per day**
- Credits reset every 24 hours
- Unused credits do not roll over

If daily credits are exhausted:
- Advanced features pause
- Standard chat remains available

---

## Step 4: Token Counting Logic

Tokens represent the **computational cost** of processing text, audio, or files.

### Input Tokens Include

- User prompt text
- Uploaded document text
- Extracted OCR text
- Audio transcription text
- System instructions
- Context from previous messages (if preserved)

### Output Tokens Include

- Generated responses
- Step-by-step reasoning
- Tables, summaries, or extracted data
- Transcription output
- Structured JSON responses

Both input and output tokens contribute to total usage.

---

## Token Counting Example

User uploads:
- 10-page PDF (~7,000 tokens)
- Asks for summary (~500 output tokens)

Total tokens processed:
- Input: 7,000
- Output: 500
- Total: 7,500 tokens

This triggers **1 Advanced Query credit**.

---

## Step 5: Audio Transcription Workflow

Audio transcription is treated as an Advanced Query.

### Audio Processing Steps

1. Audio file is uploaded
2. Speech is converted to text
3. Language is detected
4. Transcript is generated
5. Tokens are counted from transcript text

### Token Calculation for Audio

- Tokens are counted **after transcription**
- Longer audio = more tokens
- Silent segments are ignored

Example:
- 10-minute audio ≈ 1,500 to 2,000 tokens

Consumes **1 Advanced Query credit** per transcription task.

---

## Step 6: Credit Deduction Rules

### Key Rule

**Each Advanced operation consumes 1 credit**, regardless of:

- Output length
- File size (within limits)
- Model tier
- Token volume

Exceptions apply only to batch or repeated operations.

---

## Batch Operations

Uploading multiple files or running multiple tasks may result in:

- Multiple Advanced Query triggers
- Multiple credit deductions

Example:
- Uploading 3 PDFs separately = up to 3 credits

---

## Step 7: Execution and Output

Once credits are deducted:

- Task is executed using the selected model
- Tools are invoked if needed
- Output is generated
- Results are returned to the user

Execution time depends on:
- Input size
- Model complexity
- Tool usage

---

## Step 8: Usage Tracking and Visibility

Users can track usage at:

**Nexva → Settings → Usage → Advanced Query Credits**

Displayed information includes:
- Credits remaining
- Daily usage
- Monthly allocation
- Reset date
- Historical consumption

---

## Subscription Plan Credit Allocation

| Plan | Advanced Credits |
|-----|------------------|
| Free | 100 per day |
| Pro | 200 per month |
| Unlimited | 4,500 per month |

Unlimited plans are subject to fair-use limits.

---

## Add-On Credit Purchases

| Credits | Price |
|-------|-------|
| 4,000 | US$10 |
| 12,000 | US$30 |
| 40,000 | US$100 |

Purchased credits never expire during an active subscription.

---

## Best Practices to Optimize Credits

- Be precise in your request
- Avoid repeating the same task
- Use follow-up prompts instead of re-running
- Split large documents into sections
- Use standard chat whenever possible

---

## Common Questions

### Do all uploads consume credits?
No. Only deep analysis or processing triggers credits.

### Does audio transcription always use credits?
Yes. Audio transcription is an Advanced Query.

### Do tokens reset daily?
No. Tokens are counted per request. Credits reset based on plan.

### What happens when credits run out?
Advanced features pause. Standard chat continues.

---

## Summary

Advanced Queries power Nexva’s most capable features:
- File and document analysis
- Web-augmented research
- Image and video generation
- Audio transcription
- High-context AI reasoning

Understanding how credits and tokens work helps you **maximize value and avoid unnecessary usage**.
