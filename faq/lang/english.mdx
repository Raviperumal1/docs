# Rules for Using Advanced Queries

This page provides an overview of how advanced queries work, how credits are allocated or consumed, and what limitations apply when using advanced AI features.

## What Are Advanced Queries?

Advanced queries are operations that use higher-cost AI models or features.
Because these models require more processing power, each operation consumes **advanced credits** rather than basic daily queries.

Advanced queries:

- Enable higher accuracy tasks
- Support premium AI models
- Process longer context
- Handle complex prompts
- Allow intensive operations

---

## Monthly Advanced Credits

Advanced credits are provided **only to paid subscribers**.
Free users can use only basic queries.

### Summary of Monthly Allocation

| Plan      | Basic Queries          | Advanced Credits               |
|-----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Free      | Daily basic limit       | No advanced credits            |
| Pro       | Monthly basic quota     | Monthly advanced credits       |
| Unlimited | Unlimited basic usage\* | High monthly advanced credits  |

\* Unlimited plans may still include protective usage limits.

## Purchasing Additional Credits

Users may purchase extra advanced credits.

| Credits | Price |
|---------|--------|
| 4,000   | Low-tier price |
| 12,000  | Mid-tier price |
| 40,000  | High-value pack |

## Image Generation & Credit Consumption

Image generation now uses **advanced credits** instead of counting “instances.”
Different models consume different credits.

Examples:

- Free: a few images
- Pro: hundreds
- Unlimited: over a thousand per month

---

## Chat Context, Modes & Trimming

Two modes:

### Smart Trimming (Default)

- Automatically trims context
- Helps reduce consumption
- Maintains answer quality

### Custom Limit (Members Only)

- Users choose context size
- More context = higher credit use

---

## Important Notes

- System prompts count toward context
- Long chats increase usage
- Starting new chats saves credits
- Large documents increase consumption
